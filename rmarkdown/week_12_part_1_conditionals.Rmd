# Conditionals

Sometimes you need to calculate something, or change a value based on a certain condition (e.g. the value of a different column).

We have already seen in class one a aproach to this, `case_when()`, today we are going to revisit that one and see some other options.

## Using `case_when()`

LEt's look at our old friend the **palmepenguins** dataset, and let's look at the distribution of the length of the flippers among species.

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_density(aes(flipper_length_mm, fill = species), alpha = 0.4, colour = NA)

```

That is noce, but what if I wanted to "simplify" my data and **bin** the flipper length into **categories**?

I could use `case_when()` to alocate different lengths to different classes

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = case_when(
    flipper_length_mm <= 190 ~ "Short",
    190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210 ~ "Medium",
    flipper_length_mm > 210 ~ "Long",
  ))

```

One "trick" we didnt see the last time is that you can create an **"Other** class for everything else if you dont care or you dont want to type all posible options

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = case_when(
    flipper_length_mm <= 190 ~ "Short",
    190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210 ~ "Medium",
    TRUE ~ "Long"
  ))

```

## Using `if_else()`

`if_else()` is a **Tidyverse** function to apply conditional assessments.

It needs three things:

- A condition that results in TRUE/FALSE
- What to do if the condition is TRUE
- What to do if the condition is FALSE

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = if_else(flipper_length_mm <= 190, "Short", "Not short"))

```


It can get a bit complicated, but you can **nest** `if_elses()` inside of each other providing a lot of flexibility if you have mor ethan two conditions

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = if_else(flipper_length_mm <= 190, "Short",
                                if_else(190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210, "Medium", "Long")))

```

Both `case_when()` and `if_else()` are **vectorized functions**. They are very *picky* with the outputs that they give, they really do not like mixing classes, so all possible outputs need to be the same class (e.g. doubles, strings, etc). Unfortunately that includes mixing numbers or strings with **NA**

(Quick note: NA has its own class, "logical" so when `if_else()` checks to see if everything is the same class, the answer is no and it fails)

For example, lets say that we wante dto include another group to cover any other lengths outside of our range and asign those an NA.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = case_when(
    flipper_length_mm <= 190 ~ "Short",
    190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210 ~ "Medium",
    flipper_length_mm > 210 ~ "Long",
    TRUE ~ NA
  ))

```

That doesn't work, because the NA is being considered of a different class than the text

```{r, eval=FALSE}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = if_else(flipper_length_mm <= 190, "Short",
                                if_else(190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210, "Medium",
                                        if_else(flipper_length_mm > 210, "Long", NA))))

```

in the same manner, that doesn't work, because the NA is being considered of a different class than the text


Now... we could think that we could go around this by making `NA` into a character... 

```{r, eval=FALSE}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = if_else(flipper_length_mm <= 190, "Short",
                                if_else(190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210, "Medium",
                                        if_else(flipper_length_mm > 210, "Long", "NA"))))

```


but then we dont have a real `NA`, we just have some text that says "NA"

The way around it: we could "force" `NA` into behaving like a character... For that we can specify one of the *"hidden flavors"* of NA:

- `NA_real_`
- `NA_integer_`
- `NA_character_`
- `NA_complex_`


```{r, eval=FALSE}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = case_when(
    flipper_length_mm <= 190 ~ "Short",
    190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210 ~ "Medium",
    flipper_length_mm > 210 ~ "Long",
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))

```

## Base R `ifelse()`

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(fliper_group = ifelse(flipper_length_mm <= 190, "Short",
                                ifelse(190 < flipper_length_mm & flipper_length_mm <= 210, "Medium",
                                        ifelse(flipper_length_mm > 210, "Long", NA))))

```

This works. Now, there are good reasons why the tidiverse versions do what they do (e.g. prevent you from doing silly things), but if you really need to, this will allow you to.


## Complicating things, using base R's `if(){}else{}`

This is the most versatile option, however, as the most versatile, is also the more complicated to handle.

**IMPORTANT**: One problem is that **it is not vectorized**. The main "problem" with this is that the condition it uses is going to be one single value, not a vector, and if you give it a vector, it is going to use only the first value.

Check warning below.

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(flipper_group = 
           if(flipper_length_mm <= 190){"Short"}else{"Not short"}
           )


```


That means that in order to get the traditional `if(){}else{}` to work, we would need to **"walk it"** though the data set. Good thing that we now know how to do that! Let's bring all the `map()` power on!

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  mutate(flipper_group = pmap_chr(list(flipper_length_mm),
                              ~ if(is.na(..1)){NA}
                              else if(..1 <= 190){"Short"}
                              else if(190 <..1 & ..1 <= 210){"Medium"}
                              else{"Long"}))


```


Also, the base `if(){}else{}` allows for outputs that are more complicated, like model outputs, or plots!

```{r}

test_plots <- tibble(colour = c("red", "blue", "green")) %>% 
  mutate(plot = pmap(list(colour),
                     ~if(..1 == "red"){
                       ggplot() +
                         geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10), fill = "red")
                     }else if(..1 == "blue"){
                       ggplot() +
                         geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10), fill = "blue")
                     }else{
                       ggplot() +
                         geom_rect(aes(xmin = 0, xmax = 10, ymin = 0, ymax = 10), fill = "green")
                     }
  ))

test_plots$plot


```



# Loops

R doesn't care if you write something 1000 times or have it do it 1000 times for you. The second option is a lot easier for you

```{r}


i <- 2

i <- i + 2
i <- i + 2
i <- i + 2
i <- i + 2
i <- i + 2
i <- i + 2

print(i)

```


or

```{r}

i <- 2

for(counter in 1:6){
  
  i <- i + 2
  
  print(i)
  
}

```


```{r}

penguins_pepe <- penguins

```

```{r}

penguins_pepe$flipper_group <- NA

```


```{r}


for(i in 1:length(penguins_pepe$flipper_length_mm)){
  
  penguins_pepe$flipper_group[i] <- if(is.na(penguins_pepe$flipper_length_mm[i])){NA}
  else if(penguins_pepe$flipper_length_mm[i] <= 190){"Short"}
  else if(190 < penguins_pepe$flipper_length_mm[i] & penguins_pepe$flipper_length_mm[i] <= 210){"Medium"}
  else{"Long"}

}


print(penguins_pepe)

```


# Functions

```{r}

sort_flipper <- function(data = data){
  
  data$flipper_group <- NA
  
  for(i in 1:length(data$flipper_length_mm)){
    
    data$flipper_group[i] <- if(is.na(data$flipper_length_mm[i])){NA}
    else if(data$flipper_length_mm[i] <= 190){"Short"}
    else if(190 < data$flipper_length_mm[i] & data$flipper_length_mm[i] <= 210){"Medium"}
    else{"Long"}
  }
  
  print(data)
  
}


```

```{r}

penguins_pepe %>% 
  sort_flipper()

```
